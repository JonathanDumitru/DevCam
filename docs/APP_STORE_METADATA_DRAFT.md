## Category
Utilities (secondary: Video & Photo, optional)

## App Description (draft)
DevCam is a lightweight menubar app that continuously records your screen into
a rolling 15-minute buffer, so you can save what just happened without starting
a recording ahead of time.

Use the Save Clip slider (1-15 minutes) or quick shortcuts when DevCam is
active to export clean .mp4 clips. DevCam keeps recording while exports run,
and everything stays local on your Mac.

Key features:
- Continuous 60fps screen recording with a 15-minute rolling buffer
- Retroactive export of the last 1-15 minutes
- Advanced custom start/end range within the buffer
- Menubar-first workflow with export progress
- Recording quality options (Low/Medium/High)
- 100% local storage: no network, no analytics, no telemetry

Notes:
- No audio recording
- Records the primary display only
