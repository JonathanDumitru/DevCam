# App Review Gaps (macOS)

Last updated: 2026-01-29

## High Priority
- [ ] Confirm Apple approval for `com.apple.security.device.screen-capture` entitlement exception.
- [ ] Provide a public Privacy Policy URL for App Store Connect (hosted copy of docs/PRIVACY.md).
- [ ] Provide a public Support URL for App Store Connect (hosted copy of docs/SUPPORT.md).

## Review Readiness
- [ ] Validate shortcut behavior in a sandboxed App Store build and update docs if needed.
- [ ] Verify the App Review Notes match the exact build behavior (permissions, UI labels).
- [ ] Confirm App Store Connect metadata (subtitle, description, keywords, screenshots).

## Documentation Consistency
- [x] Align minimum macOS version to 13.0 across user-facing docs (matches Xcode target).
- [x] Align shortcut keys to Cmd+Option+5/6/7 across docs.
- [x] Clarify that save location/notifications apply immediately; quality changes may require restart.

## Nice-to-Have
- [ ] Add a short reviewer-facing demo video or GIF (optional).
- [x] Add a concise App Store description draft to a doc for reuse.
