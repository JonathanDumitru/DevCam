# DevCam Shortcuts

Status: System-wide shortcuts are implemented; customization is not available.

## Default Shortcuts
- Save last 5 minutes: Command-Option-5
- Save last 10 minutes: Command-Option-6
- Save last 15 minutes: Command-Option-7

## Behavior
- Shortcuts are global and work even when DevCam is not focused.
- Global monitors cannot consume events, so the keystroke still reaches the active app.

## Customizing Shortcuts
Not supported in current builds.

## Tips
- Use the menubar menu if a shortcut conflicts with another app.
- The Save Clip slider supports 1-15 minute exports in 1-minute steps.
- Advanced... allows timeline trim or custom durations with annotations.
